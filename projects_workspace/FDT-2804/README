Hello FDT,

I've taken the time to put together a sample project for you in regards to issue report issue FDT-2804. 

The project is composed of:
	- a simple jar (including source and build file) that does nothing but output a string
	- an air app that runs the jar using NativeProcess and renders the output in a text field
	- a bat file to run the app using adl.exe 

Please note, you will have to build the jar yourself using the supplied build file in project/jar/build, my email system won't let me send you a jar.
You might also have to amend the paths found in ExtendedProfileSample.as (your java path) and runair.bat (your flex sdk and project path) or write an equivilent shell script.

The problem is as follows:

FDT won't compile or run the air app app with <supportedProfiles>extendedDesktop</supportedProfiles> set in the app descriptor xml.

The following error is returned:
"invalid profile specified 'Application does not support current profile'"

If you run the included debug configuration you will see this error. If you then amend bin/ExtendedProfileSample-app.xml and remove <supportedProfiles>extendedDesktop</supportedProfiles> the app will build and run in the debugger but NativeProcess.isSupported will return false, not allowing us to run our external app.

If you run the app using the supplied batch file (and with <supportedProfiles>extendedDesktop</supportedProfiles> set in the -app.xml) you will see the app run and correctly render the output from our jar.

Look forward to hearing your feedback.

Many thanks
